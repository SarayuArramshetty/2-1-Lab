Aim of Experiment: Write a C++ program to use scope resolution operator.Display the various values of the same variables declared at different scope levels.

Step by Step procedure for the experiment

Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h)

Step 2 - Create a class name (circle) with following members as public members.radius as data member.area() as member function.

Step 3 - Implement all the member functions with their respective code(Here,we have used scope resolution operator::).

Step 4 - Initialise the num value to 100 outside the main class.

Step 5 - Create a main()method.

Step 6 - Create an object(c) of the above class inside the main method.

Step 7 - Initialise the num value to 500 inside the main class.

Step 8 - Display num with scope resolution and without scope resolution to know the difference.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit from the programm execution.
